[tank.fzz]
This file contains the breadboard schema drawing fot my tank project.
.fzz is a fritzing file. You can download fritzing from https://fritzing.org/.

[tank_pcb.fzz]
This file contains an altered version from tank.fzz, where I optimized it for my PCB. Some components are missing here as they are to be connected using jumper wires.

[tank_bb.png]
This file shows the breadboard of tank.fzz, so you can see the breadboard design without fritzing.
