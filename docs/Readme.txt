[PROJECT]
Project name: 	Halflink/Tank
Author:			Jeroen van Zwam
Date: 			Summer 2019
Project type:	Raspberry Pi 


[PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
I started this project to see what you could do with a Pi. The goal is to create a 
tracked robot which can roam around autonomiously. 
Currently there are two operating modes:
1) roaming using ultrasone sensor, by starting AutoTank.py
2) remote contrul using Xbox controller, by starting Main.py
I chose the Devastator chassis as it came with the DC motors and it looks neat.
